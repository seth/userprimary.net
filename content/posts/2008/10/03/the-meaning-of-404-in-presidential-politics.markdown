One of two websites will soon become the <em>First Site</em> of the United States of America.  Curious about how the sites were constructed, I decided to compare how each site handles a request for a missing page.  Below are some observations and comments on what I found.

First a note for my non-computer-geek readers.  When you access a web page that does not exist, the web server responds with an error code, 404, and sends back a web page explaining the error.  In the early days of the web, hitting a missing page with your browser would almost always yield a standard error page with a big "404 Not Found" emblazoned across the top.  Since then, it has become common practice for sites to customize the error message to make it more friendly and useful.  Many such customizations offer a page that fits with the visual design of the site, a link to the site's homepage and sometimes even suggestions of similar links.

Here are screen grabs of page not found errors from <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/index.php">Barack Obama's site</a> and <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/">John McCain's site</a>:
<a href="http://userprimary.net/user/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture-3.png" onclick="window.open('http://userprimary.net/user/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture-3.png','popup','width=874,height=797,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://userprimary.net/user/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture-3-tm.jpg" height="100" width="109" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="Picture 3" /></a><a href="http://userprimary.net/user/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture-2.png" onclick="window.open('http://userprimary.net/user/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture-2.png','popup','width=710,height=603,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://userprimary.net/user/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture-2-tm.jpg" height="100" width="117" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="Picture 2" /></a>
On the left is the customized 404 page on Obama's site which provides a cute error message: "we are all imperfect".  Not only does the error page fit visually with the site, but the site's right side-bar remains visible providing links for watching barack TV, donating, and getting involved in the campaign.  This approach makes sense and improves the site's SEO (for a detailed post comparing the SEO of the two candidates websites, see <em><a href="http://www.promotionworld.com/se/articles/article/080926SearchShowdownBarackObamavsJohnMcCain.html">Search Showdown: Barack Obama vs. John McCain</a></em>).
 
I was surprised to find a default 404 error page on John McCain's website letting us know that his site runs IIS and providing a link to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=8180">Microsoft Product Support Services</a> (the fact that this is IIS's default 404 page is another matter).  It's actually been this way for weeks, but I haven't had the time to put together a post about it.
<strong>The subtext of 404</strong>

What does it mean that the McCain website is missing this bit of polish (and more if you read the Search Showdown post linked above)?  Is this a demonstration of McCain's lack of technical savvy?  Perhaps it is an indication that for the McCain campaign, reaching voters via the web is not a priority.  Either way, it shows a lack of attention to detail.  The cost of a website that conforms to the best practices of the day is not prohibitive; there isn't a good reason not to have a well designed site (if it is in contention for First Site, please no comments on my lame wordpress theme).
