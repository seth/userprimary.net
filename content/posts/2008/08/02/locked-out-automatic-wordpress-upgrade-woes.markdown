This morning I decided to a bit of maintenance work on my blog and noticed that my <a href="http://wordpress.org">Worpress</a> installation was out of date with the current release.  I was running 2.5.1 and 2.6.0 is now available.

I had used the <a href="http://techie-buzz.com/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-automatic-upgrade-12-release.html">automatic upgrade plugin</a> for my last upgrade and everything went very smoothly.  This time, however, I was unable to log into the admin console after completing the upgrade.
<a href="/uploads/2008/08/picture-1.png" onclick="window.open('/uploads/2008/08/picture-1.png','popup','width=332,height=407,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="/uploads/2008/08/picture-1-tm.jpg" height="100" width="81" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="Picture 1" /></a><span style="font-size:12pt;">

</span>It seems that there is a browser cache issue, or perhaps something specific to Firefox 3.  I tried using the lost password feature and received a magic URL via email, but this also failed to work.  After finding <a href="http://muskokaoutdoors.ca/blog/2008/07/31/automatic-wordpress-update-plug-in-lock-out-problem/">this post</a> during an initial google search, I tried getting to my site via Safari and that worked.  Anyhow, perhaps this saves you some panic if you find yourself in the same situation.
