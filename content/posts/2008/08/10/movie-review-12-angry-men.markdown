Regan and I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/">12 Angry Men</a> last night on dvd.  I had not seen it before.  This is the 1957 court room drama starring Henry Fonda and directed by Sidney Lumet.  If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.  The action takes place entirely in a small spartan jury room on a hot summer night.  It's the sort of film you can easily imagine being performed as a play.  The original version, however, was televised in the series Studio One (according to IMDB).  And it runs only 96 minutes, which is further evidence that there is no good reason to make a film longer than two hours.
