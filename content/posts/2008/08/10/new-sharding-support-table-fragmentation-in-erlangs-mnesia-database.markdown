I was just browsing through the <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/part_frame.html">Mnesia User's Guide</a> and surprised to see a lot more detail on the <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/Mnesia_chap5.html#5.3">features supporting table fragmentations</a>, Mnesia's term for data sharding.  It sure looks like Mnesia has an impressive feature set for building a fault tolerant large data store.  In particular, it looks like you can manage a set of nodes hosting the db as well as the number of fragments for a given table and do add/removes of both at run time.  I need to find some time to take it for a test drive.  Is it easy to use?  Is it fast enough to use as the backing store of a high performance web service?
