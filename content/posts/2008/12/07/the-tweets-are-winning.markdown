While this blog has never seen much in the way of regular updates, I've noticed that since I've become a regular Twitter user (<a href="http://twitter.com/sfalcon">@sfalcon</a>), my rate of posting has become even more erratic.  The 140 character limit of a Twitter tweet makes it easy to share a thought, or fraction there of, without the stress induced by a large blank page of a new blog post and the expectation that one should write a well-considered essay.

Through the magic of the resizable application window, I've arrived at an ingenious compromise.  By making my blog post window considerably smaller, I've created the perfect forum for sharing the partial post, those ideas that are longer than a tweet, but not yet full blog posts.  With the current demands on my time, if I don't post the partials, all I'll do is tweet.  So I'm going to try posting here more regularly, but in short form.  END TRANSMISSION.
