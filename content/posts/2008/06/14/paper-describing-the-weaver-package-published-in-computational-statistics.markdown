It seems like a lifetime ago that I developed the weaver package for caching code chunks in Sweave documents.  The paper that I presented at the <a href="http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/dsc-2007/" title="It was awesome, I got to go to NZ to present a talk">DSC 2007</a> has finally been published in Computational Statistics.  The title is <em><a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/55411257n1473414/" title="Official download at Computational Statistics">Caching Code Chunks in Dynamic Documents: The weaver package</a></em><em>.  </em>Here's the abstract:

<blockquote><span style="font-size:14pt;">Authoring dynamic documents can become tedious for authors when a document contains one or more time consuming code chunks and each edit requires reprocessing all of the document. We introduce the weaver package that allows computationally expensive code chunks to be cached in order to speed up the edit/process/review cycle for dynamic documents authored using the Sweave framework.</span><span style="font-size:14pt;">
