Guido <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=155123">posted</a> about the possibility of Python 3000 having generic functions.  That would be a fantastic addition IMO.

He mentions in one of the comments that one way to think of generic functions in Python is as method overloading.  Whereas method overloading in static languages like Java is not nearly as flexible as multimethods, perhaps it is the same thing in a dynamic language.

On the topic of multimethods and function overloading, I find <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/object-reorientation-generic-functions.html">Peter Seibel's comparison</a> a helpful example.  BTW, it is a nice book.
