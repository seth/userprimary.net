We flew down to LA Friday afternoon.  The security line at SeaTac took forever.  The war on liquid has its consequences, but if that is what it takes to have a plane free of lip gloss, hair gel, and bottled water, so be it.

On Saturday morning we attended my cousin's bar mitzvah ceremony.  The Seattle contingent was under dressed because we failed to realize there were two separate events, the ceremony and the (black tie optional) party.  Madison did a great job reading from the Torah.  And Regan made alliah, singing the torah blessing with my other cousins (!).

The party in the evening involved a team of PPF's (professional party facilitators), virtual baseball video game, Chinese name calligraphy (kids only), organized line dancing, a sit down dinner, and a very thorough baseball theme.  A good time was had by all.  I overheard one of Madison's friends calling another friend on his cell phone and telling him, "dude, you're missing an awesome party.  You should get over here."

Sorry, no photos.
