Russ took us on a sailboat ride.  We boarded the <em>Boo Pacific</em>, a rental, at 11:00 AM just as the morning fog was burning off.  Traversing the channel behind the breakwater, we searched for the main halyard so we could raise the main sail.  With the sails up, we headed into open water and cruised up the coast to Santa Monica before turning around and returning to Marina Del Rey.  Crew for our journey: Mom, Russ, Me, Regan, Greg, and Cele.
