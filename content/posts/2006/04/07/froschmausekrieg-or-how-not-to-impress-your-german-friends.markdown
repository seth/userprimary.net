This afternoon I came across <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/boingboing/iBag?m=584">this</a> post on <a href="http://boingboing.net">Boing Boing</a> about the German word <em>Froschmausekrieg</em> which mean war between frogs and mice.

When my German colleague stopped by my office later in the day, I proudly proclaimed, "Froschmausekrieg!".  To which he said, "Eh? War between frogs and mice?  What are you talking about?"  

So I guess it is a real word, but it isn't a common idiom, which kind of defeats the purpose.

Thanks for nothing, Boing Boing.
