I recently installed <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">aquamacs</a> so far, it has been working well for me.  I really like the font support as it lets me use a font that is much easier on the eyes.

However, I'm seeing a really weird issue when editing latex files.  The verbatim environments, which are rendered in a courier face, end up getting completely garbled.  Pretty unusable. 


Here are a couple of screenshots showing what I'm seeing.  I don't know if this is aquamacs, OS X, or ???

GNU Emacs 22.0.50.1 (powerpc-apple-darwin7.9.0) of 2006-06-26 on rodrigues.inf.ed.ac.uk - Aquamacs Distribution 0.9.9d

UPDATE:

I removed some fonts that I had installed and these problems went away.  Strange.
