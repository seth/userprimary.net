Yesterday I had a 7.5 hour train ride from Vienna to Brixen.  The route was quite scenic.  Austria is very green and as we went through the foothills of the Alps I was struck at how familiar it looked; the mountains in Washington really are alpine.

Here is the train station when I arrived at 21:08.  Unfortunately, I didn't take any pictures from the train.
