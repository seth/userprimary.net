On my way to Vienna I had a couple hours layover in London's Heathrow airport.  I found a surprisingly good iced coffee at AMT Coffee.  Fair Trade coffee and they took USD which was good because I didn't have any GBP.

This was all in terminal 4 which is basically a big mall.  Tons and tons of shops.  And, of course, a Starbucks.  I didn't win a car, but there were signs promising that I could.

My flight out of Heathrow was delayed for over an hour on the ground due to thunder storms.  I had an empty seat in my row so at least I was reasonably comfortable during the wait.  Here I am after the first leg of the trip (9hrs +):

</span>I found an <a href="http://www.surfland.at/">internet cafe </a>with wifi (pay) but it isn't a cafe at all, just computers.  I have the feeling that the wifi cafe doesn't exist here.  I'm not sure people use computers in public here.
