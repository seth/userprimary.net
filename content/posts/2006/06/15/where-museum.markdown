Oh, here's the museum.  Except it turned out not to be the one I was looking for.  Vienna is a ring and spoke layout.  This is similar to the Green Lake area of Seattle only much larger.  But the main feature is preserved: it is very easy for gridders like myself to get turned around.  On my way back from the Belvedere museum I got close to my hotel but could quite get to it.  I was just off of the map I had and couldn't seem to get back on the map.
