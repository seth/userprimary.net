Today we drove to King's Lynn for the Tuesday Market.  We were looking forward to what the guide book described as a "major market" where we would find fruit, fish, <em>and</em> bric-a-brac.

The market was not as large as we were expecting, but King's Lynn was a neat town to see.  At the market we were surprised by the selection of used electric carts and "hoover" accessories.

We tried to walk along one of the famed footpaths, the Nar Valley Way that follows the Nar River.  The Nar River puts the "sluice" in sluice with its muddy banks and dark brown water.  The path out of town took us across a roadway, along a barbed wire fence surrounding an industrial building of unknown purpose, and then began following a damp ravine with no shortage of broken glass and various sorts of rubbish.

There were many such carts, some of which covered in mud, but I failed my photographic duties and these were not captured.</span></blockquote>After a quick lunch we drove to a very small village called Castle Acres where we found the walk we were looking for through green fields amongst grazing sheep, alongside the ruins of a 12th century priory, and ending at a tea room where we had a lovely "cream tea".
