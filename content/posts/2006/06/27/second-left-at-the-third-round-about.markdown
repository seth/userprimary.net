We have to skip quickly over some parts of the trip.  A few days ago we travelled from Bressanone/Brixen to Verona by train, took a bus to the Brescia airport, flew to Stansted, hired a car and drove to Ely where we stayed at a B&#38;B called The Post House.  After a night in Ely we drove (all on the wrong side of the road, mind you) to Norwich at which point we realized we had no directions, nor even the address, of our lodging in Norwich, The Old Rectory Hotel.

We walked around Norwich hoping to find an internet cafe where we could get directions.  We found one, <a href="http://www.battlenet.co.uk/" title="Battle Net">Battle Net</a>, but it was closed.  So we phoned the Ol'Rect and got directions that went something like:

<blockquote>Turn left till next round about, take the second exit to some traffic lights, get on the ring road, then straight, third round about look for B1150...</blockquote>
Finally, we asked at a petrol station where we received completely wrong directions.  Fortunately, a man overhead this and set us straight.  His directions were great.  We arrived at the Ol'Rect in no time.
