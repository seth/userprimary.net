Gum grafting surgery is a procedure used to treat <a href="http://www.gumrecession.com/thinfragile.html">gum recession</a>.  I should know since I've had it done and have the swollen cheek to prove it.

As for the procedure itself, it took just under an hour and really wasn't as bad as I had imagined.  Harvesting the tissue from the roof of my mouth went quickly.  Attaching the grafts to the two lower teeth took longer and I could feel a few of the stitches going in on the lingual side.  I didn't experience any significant pain.  The worst part were the mental images of my sliced up gums.  But there was no drilling, so that was nice.

<strong>Day 1
</strong>
Came home, ate some of the chocolate pudding that Regan had made for me and took half of a pain pill.

As the wounds were healing that evening there was much bloody gross-ness.  I used almost all of the gauze the doctor provided me with.

<strong>Day 2</strong>

Worked from home.  Overall started to feel like the wounds were healing.  No more bleeding.  Swelling very noticeable.
One side of my face looks normal, the other like I have a horse checknut in my cheek.

<strong>Day 3</strong><a href="http://www.gumrecession.com/thinfragile.html">
</a>
Went to work.  Still lots of swelling.  It looked like I had taken up chewing tobacco.  Don't worry, I haven't.  I wouldn't want to endanger those around me with <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/30961" title="Anti-Chewing-Tobacco Activists Speak Out Against Secondhand Spit">second-hand spit</a>.<a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/30961" title="eeww gross!">

<strong>Day 4</strong>

I think the swelling is going down, but it is a bit difficult to tell.
Still on soft foods only diet.  I had a dream about a grilled cheese sandwich.

I'm not the only one who got some new gum tissue stitched into their mouth and decided to blog about it (so called gum graft logging or glogging).  Check out these posts from my gum graft cousins:
