I've now been at <a href="http://www.evri.com" title="Evri (formerly Hypertext Solutions)">Evri</a> for almost two months.  I'm enjoying the startup environment, the opportunity to tackle some interesting programming problems, and getting to know my new colleagues.
I can confirm that the startup environment really is different from a research lab.  For example,

<ul><li>My inbox sees 1/100th the amount of email that it used to see.</li><li>I attend 5 times as many meetings</li><li>I'm writing a lot of Java and a little Ruby instead of R, C, and Python</li><li></li></ul><img src="http://userprimary.net/user/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/image019.jpg" height="300" width="224" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="Image019" title="Image019" />
Pioneer Square offers many more lunch options than the South Lake Union area and I like the more urban feel of the area.  I've been taking the bus and haven't yet mustered the motivation required  to begin biking to work again.

What else.  A few days before my first day, I received a welcome package "book bomb" containing a technical book and a sci-fi novel.  This is a great idea.  I plan on stealing it the next time I'm in charge of hiring people.

During my second week at the company, we had an afternoon field trip to Game Works.  I think it is required initiation at startup companies.  I lost horribly at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution" title="Dance Dance Revolution (wikipedia)">DDR</a>, but I got a great photo of my friend and colleague Deep.
