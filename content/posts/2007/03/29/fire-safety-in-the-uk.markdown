Just in case you were wondering, fire safety is still a top priority in the UK.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  I'd write more, but I have to go find my meet up point.

And at least I won't have to worry about sleeping in on Monday since I assume the weekly test of the fire alarm system will wake me up.
