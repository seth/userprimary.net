The BioC developer's meeting went well and we now have a couple of days before we head home.

This morning Wolfgang helped us make arrangements to stay in <a href="http://www.engelberg.ch/en/Engelberg/index.php">Engelberg</a> Saturday and Sunday before we head to Zurich.  So we will be at the <a href="http://www.spannort.ch/">Hotel Spannort</a> and see about some skiing.
