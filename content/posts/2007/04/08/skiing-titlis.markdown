I had a wonderful day of Spring skiing in Engelberg at the Titlis Ski area.  The views were spectacular and the snow was decent.  There was a ski rental place across the street from the hotel that provided service that put all of my rental experiences in the US to shame.  Not only did I get nice quality skis, but they took the time to measure my feet, check my weight, and ask about my preferred style of skiing (not that I had a good answer).  And I didn't have to commit to two days rental to get the two day discount.  From the rental place, I walked in full ski mode to the bus stop 30m down the road.  A 10 minutes bus ride brought me to the tram station where I purchased a lift ticked and rode up to the base of the ski area.  I skied most of the mountain and around 16.00 called it a day and took the 12 km run all the down into Engelberg.  This turned out to be a rather difficult run because the snow was so slushy towards the bottom and the hordes of people created large moguls.
