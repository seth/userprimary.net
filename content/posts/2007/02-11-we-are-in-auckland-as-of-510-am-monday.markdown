We arrived in Auckland at 5:10 am this (Monday) morning.  The journey started in Seattle on Saturday in the afternoon with a flight to SFO (2.00 hrs) followed by the flight to AKL (12.50 hrs).  We both succeeded in sleeping most of the flight away.  It went more quickly than I expected.

At the baggage claim we received two complementary overnight kits instead of our bags which seem not to have joined us on the long flight to Auckland.  The kits are gender specific.

Contents of Star Alliance Men's Overnight Kit:

<ul><li>1 Neutrogena shampoo</li><li>1 Nivea WHITENING deodorant</li><li>1 Hair brush (black)</li><li>1 Toothbrush (black)</li><li>1 Tube toothpaste</li><li>1 Envelope unmarked laundry detergent</li><li>1 Package cotton buds</li><li>1 XXL white cotton T-shirt.</li><li>1 Can shaving foam</li><li>1 razor (black)</li></ul>The women's kit has all of the above replacing white for black, no razor, no shaving foam, adding a few feminine products and reducing the T-shirt size from XXL to XL.  Maybe these are the kits for those that lost really large bags?

Our bags are on their way and will be delivered sometime tomorrow.  So said the nice man at the baggage assistance desk who told us that this happens every morning.  We have a file number and an 800 number we can call.

It was just before 8:00 am when we got dropped off by the shuttle van that took an extremely circuitous route downtown which only began after the driver waited 15 minutes in an attempt to get one more fare by finding a taker for the one empty seat in the nine passenger van.

The hotel is great and all the more so because our room was ready when we arrived.  We had excellent lattes in the cafe in the same building as our hotel.  They can make coffee in Auckland.

We just checked online (it is now 18:00) and they have no update.  This seems not so reassuring...
