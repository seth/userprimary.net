Introducing <a href="http://userprimary.net/software/extract-ical.el" title="extract-ical.el">extract-ical</a>, a small bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp">Elisp</a> that extracts iCalendar event invitations from email messages in Gnus and imports them into Apple's iCal application.  As previously mentioned, I attend many more meeting at my new job.  For each meeting, I receive an invitation email containing an event description in iCalendar format.  I had been manually adding these events to my calendar (iCal) and last week my repetitive-task-that-could-be-automated counter ticked over and I wrote up extract-ical to make this process a simple hot-key in Gnus.

If this sounds useful, please give it a try: <a href="http://userprimary.net/software/extract-ical.el" title="extract-ical.el">download extract-ical.el</a>
