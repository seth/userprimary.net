We landed in Geneva at 21.30, went through customs and fetched our bags.  The ATMs in the airport dispense single bills.  This is very convenient for the ATMs.  Between us we had two 100CHF notes and two 200CHF notes.  The machine to purchase tickets for the bus accepts only coins.  Incredibly, Wolfgang asked the bus driver if he could make change and he did.  At which point he said we could ride without a ticket until Bel-Air, which, by chance, was our desired stop, and purchase a ticket if we needed to transfer.

The map I had printed led us into a pedestrian-only section and down a quiet street to the hotel.  Lausanne at 23.30 is quiet.  We passed two young couples making their way back from a bar perhaps and otherwise saw no one.  The hotel door was firmly locked and through the window we could see that the reception desk was entirely closed.  It seemed that getting to the hotel was all too easy.  Wolfgang phoned the hotel and then a second number.  Finally, we received a code to get into the lobby where there were envelopes waiting for us with our names.
