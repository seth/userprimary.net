I came across <a href="http://www.walkscore.com">Walk Score</a> while reading a <a href="http://feeds.mattcutts.com/~r/mattcutts/uJBW/~3/148677296/" title="Clearing out my tabs">post</a> on Matt Cutts' blog.  Given an address, Walk Score plugs into Google Maps and gives you a summary of nearby services (restaurants, grocery stores, parks, movie theaters, coffee shops).  The site also produces a "walk score" which allows you to compare the walkability of different addresses.    Could be a useful tool when you are in housing search mode.

Our neighborhood scores an 89 out of 100.
