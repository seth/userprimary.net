Here's a shot from the outside of the computer lab where we held the course.

The course went well.  It was a good group that asked good questions.  My dinner afterwards left something to be desired.  I did laundry before heading over to the pub only to discover that the kitchen had already closed.  I had a beer, went back to my room and ate a cliff bar.

This morning the fire alarm was tested while I was packing up.  The siren was definitely in working order.

This evening we fly to Geneva and then will take a train to Lausanne.
